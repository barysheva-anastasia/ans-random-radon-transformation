# Random-Radon-Transformation

Repository consists of implementation of the random rodon transformation, some tests for it. Current algorithm can process binary square images that of a number of lines (they can have different thickness) and returns square black and white picture where each point represents a line with curtain probability (the measure of our confidence in presence of a particular line)
